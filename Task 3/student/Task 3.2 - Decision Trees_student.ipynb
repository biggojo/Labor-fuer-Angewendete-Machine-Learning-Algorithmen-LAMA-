    "\n",
    "Decision trees are the building blocks of some of the most powerful **supervised learning** e.g. having a pre-defined target variable methods that are used today. if you have ever had to diagnose a problem with an appliance, car or a computer, there is a good chance you have encountered a troubleshooting flowchart. Flow diagrams are actually visual representations of decision trees. For example, Higher School of Economics publishes information diagrams to make the lives of its employees easier. Here is a snippet of instructions for publishing a paper on the Institution portal. \n",

    "## CART\n",
    "\n",
    "The representation of the CART model is a binary decision tree. This is the same binary tree from algorithms and data structures (each node can have zero, one or two child nodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "A node represents a single input variable (X) and a split point on that variable, assuming the variable is numeric. The leaf or terminal nodes of the tree contain an output variable (Y) which is used to make a prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a binary decision tree is actually a process of dividing up the input space. The so-called recursive binary splitting is used to separate the input space (greedy approach). This is a numerical procedure where all the values are lined up and different split points are tried and tested using a cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The split with the best cost (lowest cost because we minimize costs) is selected. All input variables and all possible split points are evaluated and chosen in a greedy manner based on the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regression:** The cost function that is minimized to choose split points is the **sum squared error** across all training samples that fall within the rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classification:** The *Gini* cost function is used which provides an indication of how pure the nodes are, where node purity refers to how mixed the training data assigned to each node is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting continues until nodes contain a minimum number of training examples or a maximum tree depth is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we are only focusing on the classification property of the algorithm."

    "\n",
    "The Gini index is the name of the cost function used to evaluate the splits in the dataset. A split involves one input attribute and one value for that attribute. A Gini score gives an idea of how good a split is by how mixed the classes are in the two groups created by the split. A perfect separation results in a Gini score of 0, whereas the worst split e.g. 50/50 split results in a Gini score of 0.5 for a two class problem.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/iris_tree.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you find an iris flower and you want to classify it. In the figure above, we start at the *root node*: this node asks wether the flower's pedal length is smaller than 2.45 cm. If it is the case, then we move down to the root's left child node. In this case it is a *leaf node*, because it does not have any children. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose we find another flower with the difference that the petal length is greater than 2.45 cm. We move down to the root's right child node which is not a leaf node. It asks another question: is the petal width smaller than 1.75 cm ? If it is, then our flower is most likely an Iris-Versicolor. If not, it is probably an Iris-Virginica.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, 100 trainig instances have a petal length greater than 2.45 cm, among which 54 have a petal width smaller than 1.75 cm. A node's value attribute tells us how many training instances of each class this node applies to: the bottom-right node applies to 0 Iris-Setosa, 1 Iris-Versicolor, and 45 Iris-Virginica. According to equation (\\ref{eq1}) the gini score is comupted as followed: $1-(0/54)^2-(49/54)^2-(5/54)^2 = 0.168$.\n",

In addition, import the function export_graphviz which will be needed to display the results of decision trees. To evaluate the model we need to generate a train and validation set using the train-test split of scikit-learn. Hence, import the necessary functions. As a baseline for comparing the performance of the trained decision tree, we need to import the DummyClassifier. The DummyClassifer https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier.html is able to classify data points uniformly at random or to always predict the most frequent label in the training set. Import the accuracy score of the package 'metrics' for the evaluation of the classification results.\n"

    "The most important parameter of a decision tree is the depth of the tree. Hence, it is necessary to evaluate different depths of the tree to achieve the optimal performance regarding the classification accuracy. For that purpose we use grid search combined with the cross validation process we have used before. Luckily, scikit-learn has already implemented a nice and easy to use interface for that problem. The function is called `GridSearchCV` and can be found in the sklearn.model_selection library. \n",
